Our thanks go to:

* Yukihiro Matsumoto, aka “Matz”, for creating the wonderfully
  powerful and elegant programming language named Ruby.
  With him we also thank all those who have contributed to the
  Ruby programming tool and have made Ruby what it is today.

* Charles Oliver Nutter, aka "headius", and the other people of
  the JRuby core development team for bringing that wonderful
  programming language that Matz created to Java.

* Prof. Douglas Schmidt for (and all his collaborators) for creating
  a high-quality OpenSource CORBA compliant ORB. The high level of
  OS abstraction and multiplatform compatibility of this software
  make it an ideal ingredient for a Ruby CORBA implementation.

* The people of the JacORB development team (a.o. Gerald Brose and
  Andre Spiegel) and all their collaborators for creating a high-
  performance, multi threaded and spec compliant ORB for the
  Java environment.

* Minero Aoki for creating the original 'setup.rb' install script.

* Daisuke Kanda for his initial work on CORBA bindings for Ruby from
  2001 (incl. RINN and Ruby-Orbit) which has helped us in many ways
  to create R2CORBA.

* Paul Brannan of Automated Trading Desk, LLC for his insightful
  comments on the first release of the Ruby CORBA language mapping.

* Renato Lucindo and Eider Oliveira for their remarks and fixes for
  the IDL compiler.

* Ragnar Dahlen for his tests and comments.

* William Otte for his patches for the Mac OSX port.

* David MacMahon for his comments and tests, especially with regard to
  omniORBpy interoperability.

* David MacMahon for his Multi_Threading/Threads test.

* Joel Hahn for reporting the union implicit default bug and
  providing partial patches.

* Karsten Richter for reporting a bug in union implicit default
  handling and providing a partial patch and regression test.

* Grant Birchmeier for reporting the RIDL logger bug (triggered
  by an unknown pragma)

* Andrey Mramornov for reporting and testing the R2CORBA build
  problems on Ubuntu.
