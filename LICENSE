R2CORBA LICENSE

R2CORBA (Licensed Product) is protected by copyright, and is distributed
under the following terms.

R2CORBA (Ruby to CORBA) is an open source tool, developed by Remedy IT and
written in Ruby, C++ and Java. It is designed to provide a CORBA mapping for
the Ruby programming language.
Instead of going for a complete native Ruby mapping implementing a native
Ruby ORB, R2CORBA aims at providing CORBA functionality through a Ruby
extension using the DII and DSI interfaces of an existing CORBA ORB
implementation.
There are currently two flavors of this extension available:
  o an MRI Ruby extension written in Ruby and C/C++ using TAO
    (The ACE ORB; see http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/TAO.html).
  o a JRuby extension written in Ruby and Java using JacORB
    (http://www.jacorb.org/index.html).
A native Ruby implementation of an OMG IDL compiler supplements this
extension and provides powerful features like direct inclusion of IDL
language modules into your Ruby programs without the need of precompiling.

Since R2CORBA is open source and free of licensing fees, you are free to use,
modify, and distribute the source code, as long as you include this
copyright statement.

In particular, you can use R2CORBA to build proprietary software and are

code, that will prevent R2CORBA from being distributed freely using an open
source development model.
