= R2CORBA

== Description

R2CORBA (Ruby2CORBA) is a {CORBA}[https://www.omg.org/spec/CORBA] language mapping implementation for the {Ruby programming language}[https://www.ruby-lang.org].

== Synopsis

R2CORBA provides a complete implementation of the standard OMG Ruby CORBA Language Mapping ({RCLM}[https://www.omg.org/spec/RCLM]) compliant with the latest version of the CORBA standard.

R2CORBA includes:

* an RCLM compliant RIDL code generator backend
* an RCLM compliant API
* multiple ORB implementations through an extension framework

Instead of going for a complete native Ruby mapping implementing a native Ruby ORB, R2CORBA aims at providing CORBA functionality through a Ruby extension using the DII and DSI interfaces of an existing CORBA ORB implementation. There are currently two flavors of this extension available:

* an MRI Ruby extension written in Ruby and C/C++ using {TAO}[https://www.remedy.nl/opensource/tao.html]
* a JRuby extension written in Ruby and Java using {JacORB}[https://www.remedy.nl/opensource/jacorb.html]

The {RIDL}[https://www.remedy.nl/opensource/ridl.html] based, native Ruby implementation of an OMG \IDL compiler supplements this extension and provides powerful features like direct inclusion of \IDL language modules into your Ruby programs without the need of explicit, separate stub generation.

== How to get R2CORBA

Execute

 gem install r2corba

== Releasing new r2corba gems

A new r2corba ruby gem release can be made by incrementing the R2CORBA version in link:lib/corba/common/version.rb and create a new release on {github}[https://github.com/RemedyIT/r2corba/releases] matching the new version (for example v1.6.0). The github {Ruby Gem Release}[https://github.com/RemedyIT/r2corba/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Ruby+Gem+Release%22] action will automatically create a new {r2corba}[https://www.rubygems.org/gems/r2corba] and {taosource}[https://www.rubygems.org/gems/taosource] gem and push these to Rubygems.org.

A new R2CORBA taosource gem can be created by executing

  rake r2corba:gem:taogem
